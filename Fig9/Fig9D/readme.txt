#==============================================Data================================
Fig9B is made by using the scripts "plot_Fig9B.gnu". 

Plotted data with solid curves are "MFPT_tau1_4connection.dat", and "MFPT_tau100_4connection.dat" using column 1 (connection probability) and column 2 (MFPT).
Plotted data with dashed curves are "MFPT_tau1_3connection.dat", and "MFPT_tau100_3connection.dat" using column 1 (connection probability) and column 2 (MFPT).


#=============================================Codes===============================
Code used for Fig2D is used to get the data for degree-3 network by changing the nearest neighbor connections from 2 to 3.
Degree-4 network data is the same used in Fig.2B.
