#==============================================Data================================
Fig9D is made by using the scripts "plot_Fig9D.gnu". 

Plotted data with solid curves are "MFPT_fusion10_4connection.dat", "MFPT_fusion0.02_4connection.dat", and "MFPT_fusion0.0002_4connection.dat" using column 1 (connection probability) and column 2 (MFPT).
Plotted data with dashed curves are "MFPT_fusion10_3connection.dat", "MFPT_fusion0.02_3connection.dat", and "MFPT_fusion0.0002_3connection.dat" using column 1 (connection probability) and column 2 (MFPT).


#=============================================Codes===============================
Code used for Fig2D "code_MFPT_2connection.f90" is used to get the data of MFPT for degree-3 network by changing the parameter value "neighno =2" (nearest neighbor connections) to "neighno = 3".
Data for degree-4 network is the same used in Fig2F.
