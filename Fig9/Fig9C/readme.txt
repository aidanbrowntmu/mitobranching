#============================================================Data=============================================
Fig9C is made by using the scripts "plot_Fig9C.gnu". 

Plotted data with solid curves are "diffusion_fusion10_4connection.dat", "diffusion_fusion0.02_4connection.dat" and "diffusion_fusion0.0002_4connection.dat" using column 1 (connection probability) and (column2)/4 (effective diffusivity).
Plotted data with dashed curves are "diffusion_fusion10_3connection.dat", "diffusion_fusion0.02_3connection.dat" and "diffusion_fusion0.0002_3connection.dat" using column 1 (connection probability) and (column2)/4 (effective diffusivity).


#===========================================================Codes=================================================
Code used for Fig2C "code_diffusion_tau1_2connection.f90" is used to get the MSD vs time for degree-3 network by changing the parameter value "neighno = 2" (conditions of connecting to nearest neighbours) to "neighno = 3".
Data for degree-4 network is same used in Fig2E.
