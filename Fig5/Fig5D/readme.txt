#=================================================Data=====================================================
Fig5D is made by using the script plot_Fig5D.gnu. 

Plotted files with solid curves are "aspatial_a1_10_a2_0.01_cycles.out", "aspatial_a1_0.2_a2_0.01_cycles.out", and "aspatial_a1_0.002_a2_0.01_cycles.out" using column 2 and column 3.
Plotted files with dashed curves are "aspatial_a1_10_a2_0.0_cycles.out", "aspatial_a1_0.2_a2_0.0_cycles.out", and "aspatial_a1_0.002_a2_0.0_cycles.out" using column 2 and column 3.

Note: The data can also be found in the "CSVs" folder outside folder "Fig5D"
