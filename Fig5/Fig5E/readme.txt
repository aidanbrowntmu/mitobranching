#=================================================Data=======================================================================
Fig5E is made by using the script plot_Fig5E.gnu. 

Plotted files with solid curves in the main plot are "aspatial_a1_10_a2_0.01_cycles.out", "aspatial_a1_0.2_a2_0.01_cycles.out", and "aspatial_a1_0.002_a2_0.01_cycles.out" using column 2 and column 4.
Plotted files with dashed curves in the main plot are "aspatial_a1_10_a2_0.0_cycles.out", "aspatial_a1_0.2_a2_0.0_cycles.out", and "aspatial_a1_0.002_a2_0.0_cycles.out" using column 2 and column 4.

Plotted files with solid curves in the inset plot are "aspatial_a1_10_a2_0.01_cycles.out", "aspatial_a1_0.2_a2_0.01_cycles.out", and "aspatial_a1_0.002_a2_0.01_cycles.out" using column 2 and column 5.
Plotted files with dashed curves in the inset plot are "aspatial_a1_10_a2_0.0_cycles.out", "aspatial_a1_0.2_a2_0.0_cycles.out", and "aspatial_a1_0.002_a2_0.0_cycles.out" using column 2 and column 5.

Note: The data can also be found in the "CSVs" folder outside folder "Fig5E"
#===================================================================Codes=======================================================
Please go inside the folder "mitochondriaPlotter-main" and follow "README.md" to find the python code to get the data plotted in Fig.5E. 
Same snapshots used in Fig.5C are used for Fig.5E.
