Fig5F is made by using the script plot_Fig5F.gnu. 

Plotted files with solid curves are "eligiblefusion_a1_10_a2_0.01.out", "eligiblefusion_a1_0.2_a2_0.01.out", and "eligiblefusion_a1_0.002_a2_0.01.out" using column 1 and column 3.
Plotted files with dashed curves are "eligiblefusion_a1_10_a2_0.out", "eligiblefusion_a1_0.2_a2_0.out", and "eligiblefusion_a1_0.002_a2_0.out" using column 1 and column 3.


#===================================================================Codes=======================================================
"fig5f_code.m" is code to analyze a single aspatial network snapshot to determine the number of eligible fusion pairs as a fraction of the total possible pairs.
A network snapshot file is provided as the file name on line 5.
The eligible fraction is stored in the variable partners_all_norm, calculated on line 94.
