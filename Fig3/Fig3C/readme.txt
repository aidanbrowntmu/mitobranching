#=================================Data======================
Fig3C is made by using the script "plot_Fig3C.gnu" 
Solid curves are generated from "loops_4connection.out" using column 1 (connection probability) and column 3 for zero loops, using column 1 and column 4 for one loop, and using column 1 and column 5 for two or more than two loops.
Dashed curve is the data "loops_2connection.out" using column 1 (connection probability) and column 3 for zero loops, using column 1 and column 4 for one loop, and using column 1 and column 5 for two or more than two loops.

#=================================Code===========================
Please go inside the folder "mitochondriaPlotter-main" (outside Fig3C folder) and follow "README.md" to find the procedure and python code to get the data plotted in Fig.3C by using the snapshot files.
The same snapshot files used in Fig.3B are used to get the data for Fig.3C.
