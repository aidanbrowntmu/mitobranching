#=================================Data======================
Fig3B is made by using the script "plot_Fig3B.gnu" 
Solid curve is the data "connected_components_4connection.out" using column 1 (connection probability) and column 3 (number of connected components).
Dashed curve is the data "connected_components_2connection.out" using column 1 (connection probability) and column 3 (number of connected components).

#=========================================Code==================================

Please go inside the folder "mitochondriaPlotter-main" (outside Fig3B folder) and follow "README.md" to find the procedure and python code to get the data plotted in Fig.3B by using the snapshot files.
An example snapshot file "lattice_node_connection_info_p0.1.dat" is provided which is generated by using the code "code_mekesnapshot.f90" with an input dat file "centers_bond_10X10.dat".
