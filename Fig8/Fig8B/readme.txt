#==============================================Data=====================================================
Fig8B is made by using the scripts "plot_Fig8B.gnu". 

Plotted files with solid lines in the main plot are "diffusion_prob_tau1_degree2_large.dat", "diffusion_prob_tau1_degree4_large.dat" using column 1 (connection probability) and (column 2)/4 (effectivity diffusivity). 
Plotted files with dashed lines in the main plot are "diffusion_prob_tau1_degree2_small.dat", "diffusion_prob_tau1_degree4_small.dat" using column 1 (connection probability) and (column 2)/4 (effectivity diffusivity). 
 
Plotted files with solid lines in the inset plot are "diffusion_prob_tau100_degree2_large.dat", "diffusion_prob_tau100_degree4_large.dat" using column 1 (connection probability) and (column 2)/4 (effectivity diffusivity).  
Plotted files with dashed lines in the main plot are "diffusion_prob_tau100_degree2_small.dat", "diffusion_prob_tau100_degree4_small.dat" using column 1 (connection probability) and (column 2)/4 (effectivity diffusivity). 
 

#=============================================Codes=========================================================
The codes used for Fig2A (with input files "bond_pos_10X10.dat" for small and "bond_pos_20X20.dat" for large system) and Fig2C ("centers_bond_10X10.dat" for small and "centers_bond_20X20.dat" for large system) are used to get the data for degree-4 and degree-2 networks, respectively.
