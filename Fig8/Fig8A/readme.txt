#==============================================Data================================
Fig8A is made by using the scripts "plot_Fig8A.gnu". 

Plotted files with solid lines are "diffusion_prob_tau0_4connection.dat", "diffusion_prob_tau1_4connection.dat", "diffusion_prob_tau100_4connection.dat", and "diffusion_prob_tau_infinity_4connection.datt", for large system size of 20 by 20 lattice system using column 1 (connection probability) and (column2)/4 (effective diffusivity).

Plotted files with solid lines are "diffusion_prob_tau0_2connection.dat", "diffusion_prob_tau1_2connection.dat", "diffusion_prob_tau100_2connection.dat", and "diffusion_prob_tau_infinity_2connection.datt", for small system size of 10 by 10 lattice system using column 1 (connection probability) and (column2)/4 (effective diffusivity) is also used for Fig.2A. 

#=============================================Codes===============================
The same code used for Fig2A is used to get the data for larger system size with different input file "bond_pos_20X20.dat".
