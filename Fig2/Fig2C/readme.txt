#========================================Data=============================
Fig2C is made by using the script plot_Fig2C.gnu. 

Plotted files in the main plot are diffusion_prob_tau1_2connection.dat and diffusion_prob_tau1_4connection.dat using column 1 and (column 2)/4. First column is connection probability p and second column in effective diffusivity 4*D_eff.

Top left inset plots are generated by data diffusion_prob_tau100_2connection.dat and diffusion_prob_tau100_4connection.dat using column 1 and (column 2)/4. First column is connection probability p and second column in effective diffusivity 4*D_eff.

Bottom left and bottom right panels plot the data files bond_time10_p0.2.dat, bond_time10_p0.9.dat, respectively using column 1 and column 2 with grid_pos_10X10.dat as background lattice points.


#=======================================Codes=================================

For (τ=1)_degree-2 (main plot dashed curve), "code_diffusion_tau1_2connection.f90" is used with an input file "centers_bond_10X10.dat" to generate mean-squared displacement (column 4) vs time (column 1) as "MSD_time.dat". "linear_reg.f90" used in Fig.2A is used here to get the effective diffusivity D_eff by getting a suitable fit to "MSD_time.dat" file as described in appendix Fig.6. The same codes are used to get the diffusivity for different connection probabilities. 
(τ=1)_degree-4 (main plot solid curve) is the same as in Fig.2A.

For (τ=100)_degree 2 (inset plot dashed curve), "code_diffusion_tau1_2connection.f90" is used with an input file "centers_bond_10X10.dat" for a different set of rate_bond_add, rate_bond_remove to get τ=100 and the same procedure is followed to get the effective diffusivity as used for τ=1.
(τ=100)_degree-4 (inset plot solid curve) is the same as in Fig.2A.

To get the network snapshots in the insets use "code_network_2connection.f90" with input file "centers_bond_10X10.dat".
