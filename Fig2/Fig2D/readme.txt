#====================================Data=============================================================
Fig2D is made by using the script plot_Fig2D.gnu. 

Plotted files in the main plot with solid curves are "MFPT_tau0.1_4connection.dat", "MFPT_tau1_4connection.dat", and "MFPT_tau100_4connection.dat" for degree-4 networks and the dashed curves are MFPT_tau0.1_2connection.dat, MFPT_tau1_2connection.dat, and MFPT_tau100_2connection.dat for degree-2 network using column 1 and column 2. First column is connection probability p and second column is MFPT.

Inset plot is generated by using the data files "search_diffusion_tau0.1.dat", "search_diffusion_tau1.dat", and "search_diffusion_tau100.dat" using column 2 and column 3. First column is connection probability p, second column effective diffusivity (4*D_eff) and the third column is MFPT.

#=================================Codes================================================================
"code_MFPT_2connection.f90" is used with an input file "centers_bond_10X10.dat" to generate data MFPT(column 2) for each realization (column 1) as "xy_time_target.dat" (dashed curves). Final MFPT is the averaged value of column 2 over the realizations. Same code is used to get the MFPT for other connection probabilities by changing the inputs rate_bond_add and rate_bond_remove. Solid curves are taken form Fig.2B.
